* Man page changes
* man page todos
* split mcplist into mcplist and metamcplist; assign metamcplist as meta metrics instead of metrics
* split tx2mon_set_metrics to tx2mon_set_metrics tx2mon_set_meta
* fix options to match man page
* fix set[] to be defined over TX2MON_MAX_CPU
* convert contents of large switch macros (META, METRIC) into short macros that call a function
* get rid of term.h, termio.h, and unused functions; no need for interactive terminal settings.
* get rid of pthread.h, fcntl.h, any other included headers we don't actually need
* sort out copyright notices:
** identify cli-copied code by function and move it into another file with correct license header from github author.
** Identify hp-origin code by declaration or function and move it into a file/header with their license. Move hp license header to that file.
** Where current tx2mon.c code is essentially identical to meminfo.c and where you wrote the real-work code, keep it in tx2mon.c. Put current snl/ogc license header to tx2mon.c.
